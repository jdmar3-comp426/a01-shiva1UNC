        <h3>The Awakening of the Children of Iluvatar</h3>
        <p class="content">On one of his expeditions Oromë discovered the newly-awakened Elves at Cuiviénen. The Valar, aware of the risk Melkor posed to the Elves,
            beleaguered his fortress and finally overthrew him and took him prisoner to Valinor to serve "three ages" in the Halls of Mandos.Oromë was then sent to the Elves again, to invite them to come with him
            to Aman and live there. Some of the Elves did not follow him or became sidetracked and stayed in Middle-earth, and so the Elves became sundered. These notably included the Sindar, who stayed in Middle-earth
            when their king, Thingol, became lost in the forest. He was to later emerge, married to the Maia Melian, and found the Kingdom of Doriath.The Elves who accepted the summons were carried across the sea
            on a floating island.</p>

        <h3>Beren and Luthien</h3>
        <p class="content">The later parts of the Quenta Silmarillion include two stories dealing with individuals and with the relations between Men and Elves.
            The tragic yet heroic story of Beren and Lúthien (which has similarities to the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice) tells of the love between the Man Beren and Lúthien,
            daughter of Thingol and Melian and the most beautiful of all Elf-maidens. Thingol, disliking mortal Men and determined to prevent their marriage, declares that he
            will consent only if Beren brings Thingol a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown. Thus, in sending Beren on this perilous quest, Thingol unwittingly binds himself to the
            Doom of Mandos, ensuring his eventual downfall. Travelling to the mountains of Thangorodrim in disguise, Beren and Lúthien succeed in making their way into Angband
            and to the very foot of Morgoth's throne. There Lúthien reveals herself, but her beauty and charm enable her to briefly overcome the evil lord and she casts a spell
            that puts Morgoth and his minions to sleep. Beren then cuts one of the Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown, but when he attempts to take a second Silmaril his knife snaps and a shard flies off; it cuts
            Morgoth's face, and he begins to stir. As they leave, Morgoth and his creatures reawaken and Beren and Lúthien are confronted by Carcharoth, the giant Wolf that guards the gate of Angband. Beren attempts
            to hold off the terrible creature with the power of the Silmaril, but Carcharoth bites off his hand and swallows the holy jewel. Driven mad by the pain it inflicts, the creature goes on a rampage through Doriath
            until it is eventually killed by the mighty Elf-hound Huan. In this final battle Beren is fatally wounded by Carcharoth, so Lúthien travels in spirit to the Houses of the Dead, to plead with Mandos for Beren's release.
            She and Beren are sent back to Middle-earth alive, but Lúthien becomes a mortal woman, so that in time they will both die and leave the Universe together. As immortals whose souls are bound to Arda for as long as it lasts, Thingol and Melian suffer the grief of being deprived of their daughter for all time.</p>

        <h3>Túrin Turambar</h3>
        <p class="content">Also included is the story of Túrin Turambar. His father Húrin is captured at the end of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and for his defiance, Morgoth places a curse on his family. Túrin becomes a great hero, but due partly to his hot temper and partly to a string of bad luck (in fact, the working of Morgoth's demonic will), whatever he turns his hand to seems to go wrong, and death and grief haunt those around him. Making matters worse, both Túrin and his sister Niënor are enchanted by the mighty dragon Glaurung — who has sacked the great Elf-city of Nargothrond and taken up residence there — and they fall in love and live for time as man and wife. Eventually Túrin kills Glaurung, but with his death the spell is lifted. Driven mad by the realisation of their sins, Túrin and Nienor both commit suicide.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Fall of Gondolin</h3>
        <p class="content">The last Elf-Kingdom to fall was the hidden city of Gondolin. Tuor, a mortal man, was sent by Ulmo as a messenger to Gondolin, to warn King Turgon of the city's impending destruction. Remaining in Gondolin, Tuor married Turgon's daughter, Idril, and they had a son Eärendil. Gondolin was eventually betrayed to Morgoth by Maeglin, and destroyed. Turgon fell during the battle and the High Kingship passed to Gil-galad, who dwelt at the Mouth of Sirion. Tuor, Idril and Eärendil escaped, together with a number of refugees. Growing up, Eärendil married Elwing, granddaughter of Beren and Lúthien and current keeper of the Silmaril they took from Morgoth. With the help of the Silmaril, Eärendil and Elwing sailed to Valinor to plead with the Valar, asking them to pardon the Noldor and assist Elves and Men in their need. The Valar agreed to this request, and set Eärendil, with the Silmaril, to sail the skies as a star until the ending of the world.</p>
