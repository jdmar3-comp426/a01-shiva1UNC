        <h3 class="content">Elves:</h3>
        <p class="content">The Elves, who called themselves the Quendi, and who in lore are commonly referred to as the Eldar (adj. Eldarin), were the first and eldest of the Children of Ilúvatar, and are considered to be the fairest and wisest of any race 
        of Arda given sapience. Some, known afterwards as the Calaquendi (Elves of the Light), were brought by the Valar from Middle-earth to Valinor across the Sea, where they were taught by the Ainur. But after the Silmarils were stolen by Melkor, some of 
        the Elves returned to Middle-earth, where they remained until the end of the Third Age. Elves were not subject to age, and were immune to illness. They could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair.</p>

        <h3 class="content">Valar</h3>
        <p class="content">The Valar (Quenya; singular Vala) were the Powers of Arda who shaped and ruled the world. They lived on the Western continent of Aman. The Valar were the fourteen Ainur who, after being molded of Eru's thought, entered Arda after its 
        creation, to give order to the world and combat the new evils of Melkor. They had helped to begin the shaping of Arda through the music of Ilúvatar, and often referred to one another as "brother" or "sister". Each of the Ainur had added his or her own part 
        to the music creating the world incarnate, save for Melkor, who at the time was counted as the strongest of them. His vision of what Arda should have been differed from Eru's, which led to his banishment and great rebellion that would cause most of the ills of the world of Arda.</p>
